## MetroMuse Manifesto

### Vision

MetroMuse was built to empower creators, musicians, and developers with an audio editing tool that blends **the visual rhythm of a metro system** with the **precision and power of a professional editor**. Our goal is to make multitrack audio editing intuitive, responsive, and creatively fluid—like a train gliding through sound.

### Mission

- **Simplify multitrack editing** with a modern, clean, and user-first interface
- **Deliver stable, high-performance** playback and rendering through smart resource management
- **Ensure reliability**, with robust error handling, automatic recovery, and friendly diagnostics
- **Support creative flow**, through project templates, auto-saving, and preset reuse

### Core Values

1. **Performance & Efficiency** – A finely tuned mixing engine and waveform rendering system keep your workflow smooth and uninterrupted
2. **Intuitive Design** – Clean UI, context-aware project titles, and powerful keyboard shortcuts enable effortless navigation
3. **Resilience** – With detailed logging, auto-recovery, and FFmpeg error handling, we minimize friction during production
4. **Transparency & Openness** – MetroMuse is open-source (MIT), welcoming contributions, ideas, and community-driven growth

### Development Principles

- **True Multitrack Support** – Named, colored tracks with solo/mute toggles, real-time mixing, and asynchronous loading
- **Smart Waveform Display** – Scalable zoom, adaptive time grids, auto-downsampling, and detail scaling based on system performance
- **Robust Project System** – Save/load projects in `.mmp` format, access recent history, auto-save changes, and reuse custom templates
- **Cross-platform & Format-ready** – Supports WAV, MP3, AAC, FLAC via FFmpeg, with Windows binaries included
- **Performance-aware Features** – Live CPU/RAM monitoring, system-based quality modes, and dynamic resource handling

### Community & Future

- **Open Collaboration** – Contributions are welcome: features, plugins, UX improvements, or engine tweaks
- **Shared Roadmap** – Future goals include: spectral analysis, VST support, automation lanes, MIDI tools, audio recording, in-app guides, and theme customization
